# Applying k-Means on the Image Dataset MNIST

This repository showcases how to apply k-Means on the image dataset MNIST.
In particular, how to load the data, apply k-Means, visualize the results, and how to evaluate it.

You can find the corresponding post on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@tschechd/applying-understanding-k-means-on-image-data-using-the-mnist-dataset-8101fcc650eb).

## Installation

The notebook is written in Python 3.10. I suggest to install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/).
To install the same environment you can simply run ``conda env create -f environment.yml``.

Alternatively, you can lookup the dependencies in the environment.yml file and install them manually, e.g., using pip.
